# FourierNeuralMappings
Fourier Neural Mappings (FNM) generalize Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) by allowing the input space and/or the output space to be finite-dimensional (instead of both being purely infinite-dimensional function spaces as with FNO). This is especially relevant for surrogate modeling tasks in uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and design optimization, where a finite number of quantities of interest (QoI) characterize the inputs and/or outputs.

In particular, FNMs work for
* nonlinear functionals: Fourier Neural Functionals (FNF) mapping functions to vectors;
* nonlinear decoders: Fourier Neural Decoders (FND) mapping vectors to functions;
* nonlinear functions: Fourier Neural Networks (FNN) mapping vectors to vectors (going through a latent function space in between); and of course
* nonlinear operators: Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) mapping functions to functions.
